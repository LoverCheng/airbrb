**UI testing**:
1. Registers Successfully
- User Onboarding: Registration is often the first interaction a user has with your application. Ensuring this process is smooth and error-free is vital for a good first impression.
- Security: Verifies that registration follows security best practices, like not exposing sensitive user information.

2. Creates a New Listing Successfully
- Core Functionality: For platforms dealing with listings (like e-commerce, real estate, etc.), the ability to create a listing is a core feature. UI testing ensures this critical function works as intended.

3. Updates the Thumbnail and Title of the Listing Successfully
- Functionality Assurance: Updating a listing is a common user action. UI testing ensures that users can make changes to their listings without issues.

4. Publish a listing successfully
- Workflow Completeness: Testing the publishing process ensures that the entire workflow, from listing creation to its going live, is seamless and free from bugs.

**Component testing**:
1. Testing the LoginPage Component
Security and Reliability: The login page is typically the first line of defense for user authentication and security. Testing this component ensures that only authorized users can access your application.
User Input Handling: It's vital to verify that the component correctly handles user input, including validation of email and password fields.
Error Handling: Testing ensures that the component correctly handles login failures, displaying appropriate error messages to the user.
Network Interactions: Since the login process involves network requests, testing can confirm that these requests are handled correctly, and that your application reacts properly to different responses from the server.
Local Storage Management: Testing verifies that user credentials or tokens are correctly stored in or retrieved from local storage, a key aspect in maintaining user sessions.

2. Testing the WelcomeTitle Component
User Experience: This component likely serves as a part of the user's initial interaction with your application post-login. Testing ensures that it provides a welcoming and correctly personalized experience.
Dynamic Content Rendering: It's important to test that this component dynamically renders content based on user information, such as the user's name.
Layout and Styling: Since this component may include specific styling and layout, testing ensures that it renders correctly across different devices and screen sizes.

3. Testing the HintModal Component
Functionality: Modals are used to convey important information or actions to users. Testing ensures that the modal functions correctly - it opens, closes, and contains the correct content.
User Interaction: Testing confirms that the modal responds correctly to user actions, such as clicking the close button.
Accessibility: Since modals often have accessibility implications (like focus management and screen reader compatibility), testing ensures that these aspects are handled correctly.
State Management: Testing can verify that the component's visibility and behavior are correctly managed based on the application's state, which is especially important for a modal that may be used in various contexts.
